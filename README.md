## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

With this project I was able to work on the moblie-first workflow and further adjust the code to fit across all devices to deliver a great responsive web product/services.

### Continued Development

On future projects I will focus on using JavaScript and the DOM to create more complex interactive sites. I will also continue to refine my responsive web design skills in order to execute it in a quicker manner.
